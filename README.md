# Adapting "How to Design Programs" to JavaScript (TypeScript + Vite + Vitest + Immutable.js)

Welcome to the adaptation of "How to Design Programs" (HtDP) for JavaScript,
using TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, and Immutable.js! This project aims to bring
the structured and systematic approach to programming presented in the book
"How to Design Programs" by Robert Bruce Findler, Matthias Felleisen, Matthew
Flatt, and Shriram Krishnamurthi into the JavaScript programming language with
TypeScript for typing, Vite for bundling, Vitest for testing, and Immutable.js
for writing functional code. The repository includes comprehensive
documentation, exercise solutions, and resources to help you learn and apply
the principles of program design using this powerful combination.

## Introduction

"How to Design Programs" is a well-known book that provides a structured
approach to designing and developing programs. The book emphasizes the
importance of systematic problem-solving, clear program structure, and testing.
This project takes the concepts from HtDP and adapts them to JavaScript using
TypeScript for robust typing, Vite for fast and efficient bundling, Vitest for
comprehensive testing, and Immutable.js for functional programming.

## Documentation

The `docs` directory contains a comprehensive guide on adapting the ideas from
"How to Design Programs" to JavaScript using TypeScript, Vite, Vitest and
Immutable.js. It covers topics such as:

- ...

Each topic is explained with examples that are relevant to JavaScript
programming with TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, and Immutable.js.

## Exercise Solutions

The `src` directory contains solutions to exercises presented in the "How to
Design Programs" book. These solutions are implemented in JavaScript with
TypeScript typings, Vite bundling, comprehensive testing with Vitest, and
functional code written with Immutable.js. They provide insights into applying
the concepts learned from the book in a real-world programming language
environment.

## Testing with Vitest

Vitest is used in this project for testing. To run the tests, use the following
command:

```
npm run test
```

The test suite includes unit tests for various components of the project,
ensuring that your code is correct and reliable.

---

By combining the structured approach of "How to Design Programs" with the
typing benefits of TypeScript, the efficient bundling of Vite, the
comprehensive testing with Vitest, and the functional programming capabilities
of Immutable.js, this project aims to enhance your programming skills and help
you become a more proficient problem solver and software developer. Happy
coding!
